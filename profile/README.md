## Hey, welcome to the SYNTHR Github
![1500x500](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103804110/198615985-dde0a32e-c050-4bad-8057-da743c3fb5af.jpeg)

**SYNTHR** is an **omnichain synthetic asset protocol** powered by **LayerZero**, that provides users access to frictionless interoperability and slippage-free multichain liquidity.

**How do users benefit:**
1. Users can swap into any asset on any chain with zero slippage, using our internal DEX - SynthSwap.
2. Users can mint synthetic assets (by staking collateral) and add liquidity on partner DEXs - 70% of protocol fees is given to LP providers.
2. Users can create cross-chain CDPs - collateral on one chain and mint on second chain.
3. Users can trade cross-chain futures, options, and perps - collateral on one chain and trade on the second chain.

**How do ecosystems benefit:**
1. TVL - through users staking collateral for minting synthetic assets.
2. Transactions - by enabling users to perform slippage-free swaps and trading of futures, options, and perps.
3. Users - allowing users from other ecosystems to seamlessly swap into assets within the ecosystem.
4. Interoperabilty - by giving users access to multichain liquidity without the risk of bridging.

Weâ€™ve been building since **February 19th, 2021** and we dont plan on stopping anytime soon. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **over 20k commits**, opened **over 300 issues**, submitted roughly **80 pull requests** across **4 repositories**. Track the work on our [Internal Development Tracker Board](https://app.databox.com/datawall/893bef32e42ef48956c58eb5ab1156770628df6d2)!

The open source community is at the heart of SYNTHR and fundamental to how we build our protocol. If you are interested in helping us, reach out to us at nitin@synthr.io.
